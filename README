Hi, my name is Francisco Velazquez and I am a recent UC Merced graduate. I obtained a bachelors degree in Computer Science and a minor in Cognitive Science.

I would like to share a little story about my passion for videogames and technology. When I was 12 years old, I lived in Mexico and only knew the Spanish language. I owned a Nintendo 64 and loved to watch "Nintendomania" the Mexican equivalent of G4's Xplay. Through their broadcast I learned about Ocarina of Time and decided to play it.

I was in for a treat. I was moved by the graphics and gameplay, but found myself stuck within the first 5 minutes of gameplay. I did not understand one word of text. It was then when I decided to pick up a class to learn English in order to play the game. After a few years I was able to pick up the language as well as complete the game.

It was that experience that led me to choose a career in computer science. Now my next goal is to be at a place where I can share my same passion with other people. I feel like IGN would be the right place.

I would love to be part of the technical force that bring ign.com to life. I would do anything to get my hands onto projects that could change the way gamers receive information.
